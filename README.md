miami-crime-data
================

This is a repository of Miami-Dade Police Department Crime incident reports.  The reports are filtered by Month/Agency. 
We currently have "L" - Miami Lakes, but are seeking more reports to be added.

There is a dataparse.groovy program included that parses the reports to convert them into an SQL statement that is used by 
the web app created to map and analyze the data.

Although everything has been designed for MDPD reports, we are also looking to add other police departments data which we can
convert to our current data format.
